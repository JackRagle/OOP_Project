Project Name: Card Games
Team Name: Pick a Card
Team members: Jack Ragle

Project Description: This is a collection of a couple of simple single player card games. You are able to choose between playing Solitaire or Blackjack. 

UML Design: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/54a750ef-934c-44e1-9cee-1893aad0d146/edit?viewport_loc=71%2C-268%2C2208%2C1043%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_d86703ba-8c96-4309-894e-40d8bbe8b163

Plan and estimate of effort: I will create a class that is able to handle and keep track of a deck of cards. I will then have two seperate classes for each game that inherit the deck of cards methods and impliment them to simulate both games. I also plan to create a simple UI that allows the player to play the game. Depending on how difficult it will be to impliment the user interface with the actual game, it could take two weeks to complete.
